Completed:
- sphere intersections
- diffuse, metal, dielectric materials
  - abstract material class
  - scatter() defines how ray responds to intersection
- configurable camera
  - position, vfov
- anti-aliasing
  - random sample averaging
- defocus blur
- multi-threading (parallelism)
  - openMP on main render loop
- bvh
  - random axis, 4 primative leaf nodes
- triangle rendering
- triangle meshes
- Texture mapping
- Emissive materials (light)
- axis-aligned squares
- adaptive sampling

In progress:
- importance sampling (bias toward emissive)

Future:emissive)
- Path guidance
  - learn from radiance distribution to influence sampling
  - statistical or ML approach
- CUDA GPU acceleration
  - significant restructure required
